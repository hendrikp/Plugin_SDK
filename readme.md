Plugin SDK for CryEngine SDK
=====================================
This is still a work in progress, a plugin sample and plugins themselves will follow.

Tested on CryEngine 3 FreeSDK Version 3.4 (32/64 Bit)

Purpose is to create a tailored way for automatically loading plugins.
For redistribution please see license.txt.

Feature requests/latest version on github.

Extraction
==========
Extract the files to your Cryengine SDK Folder
so that the Code and BinXX/Plugins directory match up.

If you have a custom GameDll then you will need
to recompile it see C++ Integration.

CVars
=====
* ```pm_list```
  List one info row for all plugins
* ```pm_dump```
  Dump info on a specific plugins
* ```pm_dumpall```
  Dump info on all plugins
* ```pm_unload```
  Unload a specific plugin using its name. Works only limited for plugins containing resources that are in use (the CryEngine usage of those objects needs to be fully cleaned up beforehand).
* ```pm_unloadall```
  Unload all plugins with the exception of the plugin manager. Works only limited for plugins containing resources that are in use (the CryEngine usage of those objects needs to be fully cleaned up beforehand).
* ```pm_reload```
  Reload a specific plugin using its path
* ```pm_reloadall```
  Reload all plugins

C++ Integration
===============
Follow these steps to integrate the Plugin SDK into your GameDLL.

Repository Setup
----------------
* Clone the repository to your local machine to your Code directory e.g. C:\cryengine3_3.4.0\Code

```
    git clone https://github.com/hendrikp/Plugin_SDK.git
```

Compiler Settings
-----------------
* Open the Solution CryEngine_GameCodeOnly.sln
* Open CryGame Properties
* Set the Dropdowns to All Configurations, All Platforms
* Add to C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories:

```
    ;$(SolutionDir)..\Plugin_SDK\inc
```

* Apply those properties and close the dialog

Source Files
------------
* Inside the CryGame Project (Solution Explorer)
  Open the following File: Startup Files / GameStartup.cpp
* Add behind the existing includes the following:

```C++
    #include <IPluginManager_impl.h>
```

* Find the function CGameStartup::Init
* Add in the middle of the function (before ```REGISTER_COMMAND("g_loadMod", RequestLoadMod,VF_NULL,"");```) the following:

```C++
	PluginManager::InitPluginManager(startupParams); // Update the CryEngine SDK Version!
	PluginManager::InitPluginsBeforeFramework();
    REGISTER_COMMAND("g_loadMod", RequestLoadMod,VF_NULL,""); // <--
```

* The initialization of the plugin manager can only happen once because its a singleton.
  Also don't forget to supply the SDK Version as parameter so the plugins can check compatiblity.
* Add at the end of the function (before ```return pOut;```) the following:

```C++
    PluginManager::InitPluginsLast();
    return pOut; // <--
```

Compiling
---------
Either add the project file to your CryGame solution and the plugin manager as dependency for each plugin.

Or use the supplied seperate solution to compile the plugin manager.

Contributing
------------
* Fork it
* Create a branch (`git checkout -b my_PluginSDK`)
* Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Added ...."`)
* Push to the branch (`git push origin my_PluginSDK`)
* Open a Pull Request
